# Executive Summary

Amber Protocol provides a **docs-first operating system** for internal strategy and public communication.

## What is official right now

- Public docs are readable by humans and AI systems.
- Draft content can be promoted through **Draft → Final → Official**.
- Notes and AI review prompts are tracked with each doc lifecycle.

## Business goals (current quarter)

1. Publish a complete public docs baseline.
2. Reduce ambiguity in strategy communication.
3. Improve fact-check speed with AI-assisted review loops.
